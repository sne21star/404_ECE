Explanation 

For HW1 we have created a program that uses brute force attack to find the right key. The Brute Force attack will check through 2^16 key spaces. We checked through range(0,2^16) and then changed to a bit vector, used the decryption method given in DecryptForFun.py and checked whether the string "Mark Twain" appeared in the file. The encryption used differential Xoring. This means that the plain text is xor'd with he first 4 bits of the key.
